Function get_current_time:
    1. Run loop indefinitely.
        2. Try to execute:
            3. Prompt the user to enter the current time, convert to an integer, and store in variable time_now
            4. If time_now is greater than 23 or less than 0:
                5. Print 'The time must be between the hours 00 and 23'
            6. Else:
                7. Return time_now
        8. If ValueError occurs:
            9. Print 'Please enter a number.'

Function get_wait_time:
    1. Run loop indefinitely.
        2. Try to execute:
            3. Prompt the user to enter the wait time, convert to an integer, and store in variable wait
            4. If wait less than 0:
                5. Print 'You cannot set an alarm in the past.'
            6. Else:
                7. Return wait
        8. If ValueError occurs:
            9. Print 'Please enter a number.'

Function calculate_alarm_time(time, duration):
    1. Run loop indefinitely:
        2. If duration is greater than or equal to 12:
            3. Subract 12 from duration
            4. Add 12 to time
            5. If time is greater than or equal to 24:
                6. Subract 24 from time
        7. Else:
            8. Add duration to time
            9. If time is greater than or equal to 24:
                10. Subtract 24 from time
            11. If time is equal to 24:
                12. Set time to 0
            13. Return time

Function Main:
    1. Call the get_current_time function and store the result in current_time
    2. Call the get_wait_time function and store the result in wait_time
    3. Call the calculate_alarm_time with arguments current_time and wait_time and store the result in alarm_time

    4. Print current_time
    5. Print wait_time
    6. Print alarm_time
