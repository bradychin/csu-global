            3. Prompt user to enter the number of years and store in variable number_of_years.
            4. If the number_of_years is less than or equal to 0:
                5. Print 'Please enter a valid number of years'.
            6. Else:
                7. break
        8. If ValueError occurs:
            9. Print 'Please enter a number.'
    10. Define months of the year and store in variable months. 
    11. Define the number of months and store in varable number_of_months. 
    12. Create empty rainfall list named rainfall. 

    13. Iterate through the years in number_of_years:
        14. Print current year.
        
        15. Iterate through each month in the months list:
            16. Run loop indefinitely:

                    18. Prompt user to enter the inches of rainfall in current month and store in variable monthly_rainfall.
                    19. If monthly_rainfall is less than 0:
                        20. Print 'Please enter a valid amount of rainfall'.

            25. Increment number_of_months.
            26. Add monthly_rainfall into the rainfall list. 

    27. Sum the values in the rainfall list and store in variable total_rainfall. 
    28. Calculate the average rainfall over the entire period and store in variable average_rainfall.

    29. Print number of months over entire period. 
    30. Print total rainfall over entire period.
